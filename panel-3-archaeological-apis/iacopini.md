Punto Zero is a Web application developed for the integrated management of archaeological data contained within the archives of the Soprintendenza Archeologia, Belle Arti e Paesaggio, as a support tool to complement the normal protection activities of the institution.
This application allows the digitization and normalized cataloging of data, allowing, in a very simple
and automated way, the management of the historical archive, the administrative one, the dossier sector, 
the excavation diaries, the drawings archive and the photographic archive relating to every single archaeological site.

In accordance with the public purpose of the data belonging to a peripheral body of the Ministry of Culture,
the archiving forms of the archaeological sites have been structured according to the Site Card 3.0 model of the Central Institute of the Catalog to allow dialogue and the immediate transfer of data in XML format, to the SigecWeb program.

This tool is designed to complement those already existing, to give a different reading of the data entered in the system  with a purpose ranging from protection to research as well as digital cataloging of data.
In fact, the system not only provides for data archiving according to the ICCD regulations in force, but has tools that allow you to very quickly verify the interference of public works with the known archaeological heritage. These functionalities relevant to preventive archaeology, allow the competent body to have a consultation tool not only textual but also cartographic of the archaeological
evidence and compare them with the works in the project, thus facilitating the issuance of any prescriptions.
The administration system is connected to a cartographic platform, which not only optimizes the precise display of the archaeological data, but allows one to navigate the planimetry of the different contexts. The web app is equipped with a multidatation and quota management system,
which allows you to associate the chronology, depth and type of the element (wall, floor, channel) to the individual elements of the archaeological site plan. 
By compiling this data, the floor plans will automatically assume different textures according to their chronological range of belonging and type.

The Web App has been tested on the city of Ancona by archiving more than 12,000 files, relating to 159 sites.
