**Proposal text**

Gazetters are a great tool to help people gain and regain awareness of what is next to them, why "indigenous" people use certain terms, why these terms represent specific locations. Gazetteers help us understand our historic context. 

The OHM Places platform, presented at this same conference, is used in a long-running editathon about the city of Bologna, enabling users to interact with their neighbourhood of the past and helping to map out features of the territory that might be lost, while helping new citizens to understand the complexity of a city they have only often seen minor aspects of, coming as students, for work or for the family that moved here previously. The shared knowledge also helps gather local stories and narrative. 

This presentation will cover the activities preparing the editathon, the process and the current results, as the editathon will be, by end of september, still ongoing.
