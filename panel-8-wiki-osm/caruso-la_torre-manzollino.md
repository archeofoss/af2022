The aim of the paper is to explain workflows, methodologies, meanings of the 'MedAniene Project', realised through the collaborative use of Wikipedia and Wikidata by the association ArcheoFOSS.



The IT tools used are mainly Wikipedia and Wikidata.



The “MedAniene project”, involves the creation or the editing of Wikipedia pages of the Aniene Valley’s museums located near Rome and the publication of contents. In Wikidata we collect original photos of objects and places and through the creation of the specific categories we made the Linked Open Dataset of our work under the CC BY-SA 3.0 licence.



Local museums in Italy generally lack scientific information published online and effective digital communication strategies.



The museums involved by the project are the "Museo Civico Archeologico Villa di Traiano” in Arcinazzo, and the "Museo Demoetnoantropologico Castrum Vivarii" in Vivaro Romano, the “Museo delle attività cartarie e della stampa” in the “Rocca Abbaziale” or “Rocca Borgia” of Subiaco, the "Museo della Civiltà Contadina Valle dell’Aniene” in Roviano, the "Villa Garibaldi" in Riofreddo, the "Museo delle Tradizioni Musicali" in Arsoli, , the "Museo Civico di Arte Moderna e Contemporanea” in Anticoli Corrado.



The project focused on the objects in the collections, mainly archaeological and demo-anthropological, and the places where they are exhibited: the medieval castles of the 'Aniene Valley' from the 10th-11th centuries and the residences of Popes (Alexander IV and VI, Pius VI and IX) and Roman Emperors and Generals (Trajan, Nero, Narsius).



By visiting the Wiki pages of these museums, now the reader can get a glimpse of the findings, collections exhibited, and the places where they are exposed ideally to get interested in visiting the venue.



In a virtuous cycle, more visitors should also prompt the museums themselves to provide more digital contents. The project involved in a collaborative way public administrators, the scientific directors of the museums and the museum communities.



The scientific directors of the mentioned museums played a key role by providing us with the necessary material for the publication of the Wiki pages, reviewing the content and allowing the publication of material and photos under the CC BY-SA 3.0 licence.



In conclusion, we will expose the workflow used to do this collaborative project from the scheduling, through the creation of the pages, the museum's communities involving, the opening of the datasets and the publishing of the contents. We are also monitoring how the communities use the published information: making mobile apps, publishing advertisements, social posts, new catalogues.

On the Wiki pages, it is possible to analyse data about views, accesses, and clicks on shared content, to evaluate the impact of specific activities in terms of audience reached and their engagement.

This work created a digital, open, and collaborative space of communication improving the connection between these museums and their public.
