Since 1290 regular movement between cities and towns became relevant, as Amodeo Tasso's Comagniia dei Corrieri started delivering post between Rome, Venice and Milan. For this reason and for more recent situations we starteda analyzing what could be transformed into GTFS from the various forms of the past. Trains have been moving on timetables since 1839, buses since 1829, ships with less regularity forever but regularly around 1850s. 

The project aims at the definition of modifications to the standard GTFS format, HTFS adding historically relevant data and expanding the format to cover complex information, and the creation of a tool to digitize tickets, travel leaflets, schedules and other kinds of documents about any form of travel, in order to generate files that can be used with modern-day multi-modal transit planners, but looking at a realistic world of the past.

This paper covers the reasoning behind the proposed standard and some application in real life.
