Among the activities of emergence, cataloging and enhancement in place for the organization of geographical knowledge, a geoweb storage mapping was created to which various functions are attributed, from those of local archiving to those of dissemination and global consultation. It is a dynamic archive with geographic-historical paths in relation to the contents drawn up over time and present in the database of negative glass plates and cartography kept in the Library of the Department of Literature and Modern Cultures in its Geography section. The architecture of the entire system was developed at the GeoCartographic Laboratory and the initial idea of building a simple data archive replaces the more ambitious one of assembling an online system for the dynamic management of a database of images and textual contents (data on the location, geographical area, toponym, image description, real or inferred coordinates, etc.). Among the reasons that led to opt for such a structured portal is that of being part of an ad hoc assembled whole, easily manageable and reproducible by cloning, therefore, from the hardware / software point of view (virtual machines servers), a system capable of satisfying not only simple archiving but also spatial research based on geolocation. The project will depart from the theoretical approach of cultural geography as an end in itself, to focus on new ways that allow the dissemination of a geography based on new digital interfaces through the activation of connection networks that have archives in common with important geo-historical documents.
